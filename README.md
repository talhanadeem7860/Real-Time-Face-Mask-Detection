# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
This project is a real-time computer vision application designed to detect faces in a video stream and classify them based on whether they are wearing a face mask. It uses a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras on top of a pre-trained face detector from OpenCV.
